Message 2:
Message to send: "B<pin#>"
Expected results:

	2: receive message on serial that pin# is low, or if pin is out of scope, an error message
	
Message 3:
Message to send: "C<pin#>"
Expected results:
	1: high/low on pin# on slave
	2: receive message on serial of the state of pin#, or if pin is out of scope, an error message
	
Message 4:
Message to send: "D<pin#>"
Expected results:
	1: pin# on slave to go high for 5 seconds (5000ms)
	2: receive stream of responses over serial saying that the line is locked, or if pin is out of scope an error message
